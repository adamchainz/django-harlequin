Launch `Harlequin <https://harlequin.sh/>`__, the SQL IDE for your Terminal, with your Django database configuration.

----

**Work smarter and faster** with my book `Boost Your Django DX <https://adamchainz.gumroad.com/l/byddx>`__ which covers many tools to improve your development experience.

----

Requirements
============

Python 3.8 to 3.12 supported.

Django 3.2 to 5.0 supported.

Supported database backends: MariaDB/MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite.

Installation
============

**First,** install with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install django-harlequin

**Second,** install the appropriate Harlequin `adapter package <https://harlequin.sh/docs/adapters>`__ for your database backend.
For example, for the `PostgreSQL adapter <https://harlequin.sh/docs/postgres/index>`__:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install harlequin-postgres

**Third,** add the app to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...,
        "django_harlequin",
        ...,
    ]

Usage
=====

``harlequin`` command
---------------------

Run the ``harlequin`` management command to launch Harlequin, connected to your default database:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./manage.py harlequin

Pass ``--database`` to select a different database connection from ``settings.DATABASES``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./manage.py harlequin --database replica

Extra options, optionally after a ``--`` delimiter, will be passed through to Harlequin.
For example, to read its help page, as opposed to that of the management command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./manage.py harlequin -- --help

Configuration
=============

Harlequin automatically loads configuration from ``pyproject.toml`` or its own files within the current working directory, which would mean next to your ``manage.py`` file.
See Harlequinâ€™s `configuration documentation <https://harlequin.sh/docs/config-file>`__ for details on the available options.
